# WebScraper
This was a small personal project I did for fun and to explore backend web development with PHP. 

In this project I wrote a PHP script that takes in a website url and scrapes that site for links and images then displays them in a list to the user. 

The purpose of this project was only to explore my interest in learning about PHP and backend web development. 

## What is a Web Scraper?
A web scraper, also known as a Spider or Crawler is a bot used to collect data from websites. Most notably Google's own scraper called Googlebot is what makes modern day search engines possible. 

These bots are tasked with updating and finding new links to web pages on the internet. Once they find one link they'll discover other internal and outbound links connected to that page and it will go to those and collect more data. 

Google and other search engines then index these links and is how websites show up on search. 

## My Web Scraper
The web scraper that I've put together here is very basic and only takes one URL and provides you a list of websites and images that it finds. 

It then will reconstruct any images it has found and display them to you. 

## Collecting Data
This is mostly a proof of concept but if you wanted to you could slightly modify this script to find whatever data you're looking for. 
Deploy this onto a web server. 
Then you could make it store data into a database and from there follow more links.
Turning this simple script into an actual scraper online for data. 

## Conclusion of The Project
This was a project I wanted to explore on my own as I taught myself some very basic PHP. 

While learning about front end web development like html, css, and js, I wanted to learn more about how the back end of running websites and servers work which led me to researching php and what it could do. 

This was an idea for a project that was of personal interest to me and I'm glad I taught myself a bit about it although it was never used for anything. 

If you have questions feel free to reach out to me via github. If you want to use this code for yourself please feel free to do so.
